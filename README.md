I want to get used to making managable scopes for projects so I don't get burnt out
  <h4>Tip: In command prompt:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>cd -> goes into file</li>
  <li>cd.. -> backtracks to the folder above </li>
  <li>You have to install openSSL for node to work in command prompt. When downloading Node, choose to install extra files, then you can do-> choco install openssl</li>
  <li>While writing cd and then a file/folder name after, press tab to auto complete the name of the file/folder</li>
</ul>
<h4>Clean code tips:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Don't use comments unless necessary e.g: calculation for bmi in plain english</li>
  <li>Sometimes function and code can explain itself, comments aren't always necessary, it can be read in the git log of a project/repo</li>
  <li>Delete code that isn't being used/not needed anymore.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Node - NPM - jest tips:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The directory of the files can mess with using jest, the solution was to make a simple directory with a simple name. (Maybe the folder called, '.git' messed with locating the files)</li>
  <li>If there is a similar situation where something doesn't work and you don't know why, maybe replicating or doing the task completely from scratch, (by pretending you are a new user) is a good idea.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Other Tips:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Methods can be chained together in one line, such as array methods for example: string.split('').reverse().join('');</li>
</ul>
